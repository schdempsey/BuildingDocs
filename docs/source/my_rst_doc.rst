Section1: Fingers Crossed

.. Apparently two dots are a comment, also
    note that there is always a space to a new paragraph

In this section I'm hoping to complete some sort of paragraph that is written concisely and succintly. In the next paragraph I'm going to add even more text!!!!!! let's gooooooo

Paragraph two here, let's see what goes on next. Here comes a big **Wave** oh my gosh. And out of nowhere, and Italian man is running around screaming *Oh, ahamah gawd, this wave is sucha big one, mamma mia*.

Section2: Let's Get to Naming!

.. _Sec2_Lists:
This section will be broken down into 2 lists for bullets and numbers.

My favourite restaurants are

- Yummy food
    * literally any food
- Any ramen joint

As for movies, that's a separate story:

1) Bo Burnham's *Inside*
#) Ian Fleming's James Bond *No Time To Die*
